Introduction
------------

Lochness is a data management tool designed to periodically pull and download
data from various data archives into a local directory. This is often referred
to as building a "data lake" (hence the name). This repository is a fork from
`harvard-nrg lochness <https://github.com/harvard-nrg/lochness>`_, updated and
maintained by DPACC for U24 project.


AMP-SCZ Lochness has a number of extra functions, many of which are specific
to PRONET and PRESCIENT research networks within the U24 study. However, extra
data sources such as `Box <https://box.com/>`_, `Mediaflux
<https://www.arcitecta.com/mediaflux/features/>`_,
`RPMS <https://data.orygen.org.au/>`_, and
`Mindlamp <https://www.digitalpsych.org/lamp.html>`_ could be useful for other
studies as well.


The main difference of the AMP-SCZ Lochness, from the original harvard-nrg 
Lochness, is that AMP-SCZ requies database of unique subject IDs in one of
``REDCap`` or ``RPMS`` to make a list of subject IDs to be used with Lochness
(``metadata.csv``), which will be used in searching for any data to download.


Therefore, required and supported data sources are

    - Required
        - REDCap or
        - RPMS

    - Supported
        - XNAT
        - Box
        - Mediaflux
        - Mindlamp

Please report any bug or issue to our 
`github repository <https://github.com/AMP-SCZ/lochness/issues>`_. Thanks!
