Lochness: Sync data from all over the cloud to a local directory
================================================================
Lochness is a data management tool designed to periodically poll and 
download data from various data archives into a local directory. This 
is often referred to as building a "data lake" (hence the name).

Out of the box there is support for pulling data down from Beiwe, XNAT, 
REDCap, Dropbox, external hard drives, and more. Extending Lochness to 
support new services is also a fairly simple process.
