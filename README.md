Lochness: Sync data from all over the cloud to a local directory
===============================================================
Data management typically begins with safely capturing data and presenting it 
to end users in a familiar and ergonomic way. Lochness was designed to provide 
a simple (and extensible) command line tool to periodically poll and download 
data from various data archives into a local directory. This is often referred 
to as building a "data lake", hence the name! 

Out of the box there's support for pulling data from Beiwe, XNAT, REDCap, 
Dropbox, external hard drives, and more. Extending Lochness to support new 
services is also a fairly simple process too!
