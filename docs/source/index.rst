Welcome to AMP-SCZ Lochness's documentation!
====================================

Lochness is a data management tool designed to periodically poll and download
data from various data archives into a local directory. This is often referred
to as building a "data lake". This repository was originally forked from
`harvard-nrg/lochness <https://github.com/harvard-nrg/lochness>`_ in 2020.
But since then, it has been greatly enhanced and actively maintained by DPACC for 
the AMP-SCZ project.
